# Verifies that the author of a pull request has a CLA signature on record.
#
# The signature is a file the contributor adds in their own pull request
# (.github/cla/<version>/<login>.md), so the ref this workflow checks out already contains it —
# which is why this needs no bot, no external service, no personal access token, and no write
# permission. Inputs arrive through the environment rather than being read out of the event
# payload here, so the same script can be exercised locally.
#
# Note on what this does and does not enforce: for a pull request from a fork, GitHub runs the
# workflow as it exists on the pull request's own branch, so this check is advisory against a
# contributor who edits it away. That is visible in the diff, and merging is a human decision —
# the alternative (pull_request_target) would hand fork code a write-scoped token, which is a
# worse trade for a licensing gate.

saem is dual-licensed (AGPL-3.0 + commercial), so a contribution can only be merged once the
rights to distribute it under both sets of terms have been granted. Signing takes one file:

  1. Read CLA.md.
  2. Add $signature to this pull request, using the template in CLA.md under "Signing".

Signing once covers your later contributions while version ${version} of the agreement is current.
